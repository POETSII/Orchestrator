# Orchestrator

The Orchestrator is the configuration and run-time management system for POETS
platforms.

Be sure to take a look at the user documentation at
https://github.com/POETSII/orchestrator-documentation for building and running
instructions, including dependency information, environment setup, and
command-line invocation.

The Orchestrator is a work in progress; please submit issues using the GitHub
issue tracker, and the development team will respond.

Note: This repository contains Tinsel as a submodule. This is not needed for
operation on Tinsel-POETS boxes (because they already have a Tinsel
installation), but if you wish to build or run the Orchestrator elsewhere, you
will need this submodule.
