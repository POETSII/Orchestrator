 - [X] Make Motherships post on app state transition.
 - [X] Consume Mothership deployed/ready/running/stopped acknowledgements, and
   print a nice message when they're all received by root (counting in some
   persistent data structure I haven't made yet).
 - [X] Set up Mothership acknowledgement on error, and update deplStat in Root.
 - [ ] When one Mothership sends an error, propagate that to other Motherships.
 - [ ] Allow recall to break through error, and clear that error state in Root
   once all Motherships have acknowledged.
 - [ ] Strongly consider abstracting all of this Mothership-communication logic
   (in Root and OrchBase) into a class of its own, and incorporate it into the
   Mothership documentation.
 - [ ] Test above functionality.
 - [ ] Update user guide with new outputs
 - [ ] Update Mothership documentation to explain what the acknowledgements are
   used for.
 - [ ] Add error request (MSHP,REQ,BRKN) packet to Mothership documentation.
