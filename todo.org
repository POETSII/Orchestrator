 - [ ] Make Motherships post on app state transition.
 - [ ] Consume Mothership deployed/ready/running/stopped acknowledgements, and
   print a nice message when they're all received by root (counting in some
   persistent data structure I haven't made yet).
 - [ ] Set up Mothership acknowledgement on error, and update deplStat in Root.
 - [ ] Allow recall to break through error.
 - [ ] When one Mothership sends an error, propagate that to other Motherships.
