Logic in this directory defines the intermediate translation between hardware
files and configuration datastructure when reading dialect 1 inputs. These
intermediate translations (deployers), can then define P_engines, and their
contained items. This directory also contains logic that defines default
configurations.

Dialect 3 input files do not use a deployer; the reader inputs the information
into the Engine directly.

Dialect 2 input files are not supported.
